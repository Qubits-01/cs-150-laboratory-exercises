# Study of Programming Languages I

## Learning Journey

Greetings! Welcome to my repository dedicated to the study of Programming Languages I. In this learning journey, I will articulate my experiences and insights as I delve into the multifaceted realm of programming languages and paradigms. My primary learning goals for this repository encompass the following objectives:

1. **Illustrate Aspects and Tradeoffs of Programming Paradigms and Language Constructs:** My aim is to cultivate a profound understanding of various programming paradigms and language constructs. I will scrutinize practical examples and case studies to discern the inherent strengths and tradeoffs associated with each paradigm.

2. **Utilize Type System Features to Properly Drive Program Design and Evolution:** The role of type systems in the creation of robust and maintainable software is of paramount importance. My intention is to investigate both static and dynamic typing to ascertain their influence on program design, evolution, and the overall quality of code.

3. **Design Object-Oriented Programs Exhibiting High Cohesion and Loose Coupling:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a ubiquitous paradigm, and I aspire to attain mastery within this domain. My ambition is to engineer OOP programs that exemplify high cohesion, wherein components operate harmoniously, and loose coupling, which minimizes interdependencies between components.

4. **Employ Functional Programming Principles and Features to Manage Program Complexity:** The management of escalating software complexity mandates an exploration of functional programming. I shall delve into facets such as immutability, higher-order functions, algebraic data types, and other concepts, which are instrumental in simplifying code and rendering it more maintainable.

5. **Reactive and Event-Driven Programming:** The universe of event-driven programming is indispensable for the development of interactive and responsive software. I will explore graphical interfaces, event handlers, and observables to construct captivating applications.

6. **Concurrent Programming:** In light of the prevalence of multi-core processors, an in-depth understanding of concurrent programming is imperative. My objective is to assimilate concepts encompassing async/await, promises, the Actor model, and shared-state concurrency in order to construct efficient, parallel software.

7. **Logic Programming:** Logic programming, epitomized by miniKanren and Prolog, offers a declarative approach to problem-solving. My ambition is to comprehend the utilization of logic-based programming for the efficient resolution of complex problems.

## My Learning Path

To chart a course through these expansive topics, I have formulated a structured learning path as follows:

1. **Programming Languages:** Commencing the journey with a comprehensive exploration of JavaScript and TypeScript, both widely-adopted languages with diverse paradigms. A comparative analysis of their features and strengths will be undertaken.

2. **Type Systems:** A meticulous study of static typing and dynamic typing will be pursued, encompassing an examination of their impact on code correctness and development processes.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming:** Delving deeply into message passing, interfaces, composition, SOLID principles, and design patterns to enhance proficiency in the realm of Object-Oriented Programming.

4. **Functional Programming:** Extensive practice involving immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types will be undertaken, with practical application in real-world projects.

5. **Reactive and Event-Driven Programming:** Hands-on experience will be gained by constructing graphical interfaces and interactive applications, thereby providing practical insights into event-driven programming.

6. **Concurrent Programming:** Practical projects will be executed to harness the capabilities of multiple cores efficiently, while concurrently addressing challenges related to shared-state concurrency.

7. **Logic Programming:** I shall embark on an exploratory journey with miniKanren and Prolog, unveiling the potency of logic-based programming in the context of complex problem-solving.
